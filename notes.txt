Features to add:
    - Ranking over time: ranking last months
    - Ranking should come from ranking files and not match files

    - Last x (5 currently) matches could be an argument (5, 10, 15, etc...)
    - Using nb of games played instead of nb of sets ?

    - % Victory against players of same rank as adv


Improvements:
    - Best Rank does not work
    - cut cache in several files for dynamic loading with different parameters
    - player.versus should not be given as a whole from match but only versus against adv ?

    - encoding last x matches [v, v, v, d, d] => [1, 1, 1, 0, 0]
    - encoding last x matches versus

    - use match elapsed minutes to model fatigue

Done:
    - Fix columns names
    - Remove all persons from versus
    - add unique match ID to link to original matches data
    - add concatenation of players stats at match time, result & match stats
    - age at match time not well handled
        # Either get it from match data (easier)
        # Or better handling birthdate vs match date
    - have better historic of matches order & versus matches = {id: [date, result], [date, result], ...]}
    - Remove double data
